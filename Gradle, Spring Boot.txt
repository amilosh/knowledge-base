Gradle has a list of default tasks. You can find these tasks on Gradle tab inside Idea.
These tasks have default behaviour.
Task can consist of some other tasks. (e.g. bootJar: compileJava, processResources, classes, bootJarMainClassName, bootJar).
If previous tasks was already done, Gradle doesn't run them again. Instead of it Gradle write message (e.g. compileJava UP-TO-DATE).
