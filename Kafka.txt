We create topic.
  Producer and consumer subscribes to topic.

Topic has:
  partition - stored opies of messages, need for parallelism and saving data
    there is leader partition
  replicationFactor

If topic has only one partition, topic can have only one consumer.

Topic can has:
  many gropus (with consumers inside)

Consumers are collected to groups.

RabbitMQ - push type. Consumers subscribe to broker, when message is sent to broker, it immidiatelly pushes to consumer.
Kafka - pull type. Consumers pull messages from broker.

Messages are not deleted from queue.
Offset - how many messages was read from queue.
  We can read message many times.
