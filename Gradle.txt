Gradle has a list of default tasks. You can find these tasks on Gradle tab inside Idea.
These tasks have default behaviour.
Task can consist of some other tasks. (e.g. bootJar: compileJava, processResources, classes, bootJarMainClassName, bootJar).
If previous tasks was already done, Gradle doesn't run them again. Instead of it Gradle write message (e.g. compileJava UP-TO-DATE).

Gradle tasks:
bootJar
  generates bootJarMainClassName
  generates *.jar file
jar
  generates *.jar file

gradle clean build - will create build/libs/{app_name}-{app_verion}.jar file
change app_name and app_verion:
  app_name - inside settings.gradle
    rootProject.name = 'app'
  app_verion - inside build.gradle
    version = '0.0.1'

gradle bootRun - run Spring Boot application from cmd
 
Generate *.war file:
  add to build.gradle:
    plugins {
        id 'war'
    }

Run application from *.jar file:
  java -jar app.jar
